Problem: rasberrypi


This application utlizes several standard libraries(iostream, algorithm, string, and SFML)

SFML is a seperate library and when you use g++ to compile with it, you need to compile the program in a certain way. I put SFML in a non-standard path. 

g++ -c main.cpp -I<sfml-full-install-path>/include 
(sfml-install-path is the directory where you copied SFML)


Then you have to link the compiled file to the SFML libraries to get the final executable. SFML is made of 5 modules(system, window, graphics, network and audio)

g++ main.o -o main-sfml-app -L<sfml-full-install-path>/lib -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system 

lastly you can execute the app with ./main-sfml-app or in my case, i installed SFML to non standard path, therefore you must execute the following command

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<sfml-full-install-path>/lib && ./main-sfml-app


export is a command that changes an environmental variable and passes it to a program
